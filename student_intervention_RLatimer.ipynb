Using SVM, you are able to develop a set of rules that can be used to classify each person as either Male or Female. If a person is taller than average and has shorter-than-average hair, signs would point to that person being a male. And vise versa for female: shorter height and longer hair. SVMs are also commonly used in image recognition, speech recognition, and face detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: \n",
    "SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces, even in situations where there are more features than total samples! SVMs are versatile because one can use kernels to further drive data toward linear separability. They are also memory efficient, which is never a bad thing!\n",

It yeilded a higher F1 score in comparison to the other models, suggesting it most accurately identifies and appropriately classifies at-risk students in need of an intervention (recall and precision). Training and testing times of the SVM model were relatively efficient compared to the other models, and much faster than the Random Forest model. In addition to having the highest F1 score, the SVM model does not have as high of a risk of over-fitting the data as the Decision Tree model, and the SVM model is suitable to be used in conjunction with additional tests (kernels) that can further improve the model's confidence level."

    "**Answer: ** The goal for this project was to accurately identify students who might need an early intervention before they fail to graduate. We started by gathering all possible information we had on 395 students, consisting of information such as: age, whether the student has internet access at home, number of absences, and more (30 different features in total). Of those 395 students, 265 students passed and 130 failed. Because we have a vast amount of features for each student but a relatively small sample size of students to analyze, it was deemed that a Support Vector Machine model (SVM) would be a suitable candidate for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Machine model works to identify commonly found behaviors or traits that differ between students that graduated and those that failed. It does this by establishing a decision boundary that acts as a border between the two groups. An optimal decision boundary is one that, not only, draws a dividing line between the two groups, but also maximizes the margins of separation of the groups. The illustration below should provide a valuable visualisation. A good example would be to the Korean Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea. Imagine the \"Best Line\" as the border itself, but each \"Support Line\" acts as an additional barrier that prevents individuals from getting too close to the border. By maximizing the distance of separation, we should have a clearer distinction between the two groups.\n",

    "One issue arises when we are faced with a nonlinearly-separable dataset (try saying that three times fast!) where there isn't a clear visual separation between the two groups. Fortunately for us, the SVM model has a few tricks up its sleeve! By using what's known as the 'Kernel Trick' (illustrated below), we are able to tweak the unseparable data points into a more digestable form that ALSO maintains the core relationships between the points. We're essentially translating the data from a foreign language into our native tongue, where the story stays the same, but is told in a language we can better understand.\n",
